# struts_demo
# Simple struts MVC concept that exposes tables owned by an Oracle user and their column definitions. 
# Any Oracle client will provide the same table and column metadata views, but code could be expanded to render simple queries.
# Hibernate, Spring not used here as intended as a db-specific data dictionary perhaps for those unfamiliar with Oracle.
